# Gopass to Bitwarden

A python script that I've written to transfer my passwords from Gopass to
Bitwarden. It takes in the passwords in the format that Gopass generates
them and outputs a json file containing all the password information to be
uploaded to Bitwarden. Requires a new version of python3, python-gnupg, and pyyaml.

**I am not a security expert, I'm just a guy who wanted to switch password managers. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
